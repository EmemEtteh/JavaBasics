- **main**

The *main* method is doesn't have a large amount of code, 
to keep it simple when testing

Contains an integer variable, initialised with 10.

- String greeting

Real bulk of the code. It contains a String variable, 
initialised with "greetings". Also, the method has the int
variable as a parameter.

Multiple conditions are used to check the int variable,
known as TimeOfDay, and output different message values.
Once done, the message variable is returned, and is used in
the main method
