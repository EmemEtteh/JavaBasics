# Spartan Java Work

### BubbleSort

This is a program that takes an array of numbers, and 
sorts it in order. It works by swapping each consecutive pair of 
numbers (so in the array {1,5,3}, 1 and 5 are swapped, then 1 and 
3 are swapped) until the list is ordered.

### Palindrome

This is a program that has a few methods
- One method converts all characters to lower case, so it can be valid
to test as a palindrome.
- The second method checks if an inputted word is indeed a 
palindrome ("dad" is a palindrome, "dab" isn't).
- The third method takes a string, and returns the longest palindrome
inside it ("the repaper is poop": repaper would be returned, not 
poop).

### Fibonacci
This is a program that takes a number as an input, which is the
position to find, and returns an output of the fibonacci sequence
up until that position (position 5 returns 5)

This is done __recursively.__ The method calls itself until it
reaches a base case.
